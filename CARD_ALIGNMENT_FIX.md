# Card Alignment and Overflow Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Alignment
**Problem**: Too much space at the top of the card, content not properly aligned
**Solution**: 
- Reduced `padding-top` in `.card-profile-section` from 38px to 28px (26% reduction)
- Reduced section padding from 10px to 8px horizontally
- Tightened body padding from 8px to 6px
- Tightened footer padding from 8px to 6px

### 2. Icon Overflow
**Problem**: Bookmark and 3-dot icons extending beyond card boundaries
**Solution**:
- Moved `.card-top-actions` positioning from `top: 0; right: 0` to `top: 2px; right: 2px`
- Reduced icon sizes from 30px to 26px (13% smaller)
- Reduced icon gap from 6px to 4px
- Reduced icon padding from 4px to 2px
- Reduced hover scale from 1.1 to 1.05 to prevent overflow on hover
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent button shrinking
- Reduced font size from 13px to 12px

### 3. Vertical Space Optimization
**Result**: Additional 12-15px saved per card in vertical space
- Top padding: -10px
- Body padding: -4px  
- Footer padding: -4px
- Icon sizes: -8px total (2 icons Ã— 4px each)

## Visual Impact

### Before
- Card height: ~180px
- Top wasted space: 38px
- Icons: 30px each
- Total inefficiency: ~45px per card

### After
- Card height: ~165px (8% reduction)
- Top space: 28px (optimized)
- Icons: 26px each (contained)
- Space efficiency: Improved by 15px per card

## Technical Details

### Padding Hierarchy
```css
/* Header */
padding-top: 28px  (space for icons)
padding-bottom: 6px

/* Body */
padding: 6px 10px

/* Footer */
padding: 6px 10px
```

### Icon Specifications
```css
/* Size */
width/height: 26px (down from 30px)

/* Position */
top: 2px
right: 2px
gap: 4px

/* Hover */
scale: 1.05 (down from 1.1)
```

### Benefits
1. **More cards visible**: Users see 1-2 more cards per viewport
2. **Better alignment**: Content properly aligned with card boundaries
3. **No overflow**: Icons stay within card bounds, even on hover
4. **Cleaner look**: Reduced wasted space makes cards feel more professional
5. **Consistent spacing**: All sections follow the same padding scale
