# Directory Role Badge Fix

## Problem Statement
The directory cards were showing "Alumni" role badge for all users regardless of their actual role (student, faculty, employer, institute, etc.). Additionally, admin users should not be visible in the directory.

## Root Cause
1. The `/users/directory` API endpoint was not including the `role` field in the SQL SELECT query
2. Admin filtering was only done on the client-side, which is inefficient and unreliable
3. The client-side code was trying to use `user_type` as a fallback, which doesn't exist in the API response

## Solution Implemented

### Server-Side Changes (`server/api/users.js`)
1. **Added `role` field to SELECT query** (line 106):
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, full_name, email, profile_pic_url, verification_status, 
          job_title, company, major, graduation_year, city, role, 
          is_email_visible, is_company_visible, is_location_visible
   FROM users WHERE is_profile_public = TRUE AND role != 'admin'
   ```

2. **Added server-side admin filtering** (line 107):
   - Added `AND role != 'admin'` to the WHERE clause
   - This ensures admin users are never returned in directory results

3. **Include role in response mapping** (line 147):
   ```javascript
   role: user.role, // Include role for badge display
   ```

### Client-Side Changes (`client/js/directory.js`)
1. **Removed redundant client-side admin filtering** (lines 506-510):
   - Deleted the filter logic that was checking for admin role
   - Simplified code since filtering is now done server-side

2. **Simplified role mapping** (line 531):
   ```javascript
   role: alumnus.role || 'alumni' // Use role from API response
   ```
   - Removed fallback to `user_type` which doesn't exist
   - Removed debug console.log statements

3. **Updated comments** to reflect server-side filtering

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. ✅ Alumni users see "Alumni" badge (purple/blue color)
2. ✅ Student users see "Student" badge (green color)
3. ✅ Faculty users see "Faculty" badge (orange color)
4. ✅ Employer users see "Employer" badge (red color)
5. ✅ Institute users see "Institute" badge (purple color)
6. ✅ Admin users are NOT visible in the directory at all

## Role Badge Configuration
The role badges are configured in `client/js/directory.js` (lines 129-136):

```javascript
const roleConfig = {
    alumni: { label: 'Alumni', icon: 'fa-user-graduate', color: '#667eea' },
    student: { label: 'Student', icon: 'fa-graduation-cap', color: '#10b981' },
    faculty: { label: 'Faculty', icon: 'fa-chalkboard-teacher', color: '#f59e0b' },
    employer: { label: 'Employer', icon: 'fa-building', color: '#ef4444' },
    institute: { label: 'Institute', icon: 'fa-university', color: '#8b5cf6' },
    admin: { label: 'Admin', icon: 'fa-user-shield', color: '#dc2626' }
};
```

## Testing Verification
- ✅ JavaScript syntax validation passed for both files
- ✅ SQL query structure is correct
- ✅ Role field properly mapped in API response
- ✅ Client-side code correctly uses the role field

## Files Modified
1. `server/api/users.js` - Directory endpoint
2. `client/js/directory.js` - Directory card rendering

## Security Note
Admin filtering is now done on the server-side, which is more secure and prevents any potential client-side bypass. Admin users will never be included in the directory API response.
