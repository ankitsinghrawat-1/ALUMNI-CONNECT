    {
      "user_id": 1,
      "full_name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "alumni",

    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalItems": 58,
    "itemsPerPage": 12,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPrevPage": false

}
```

**Security:**

- Privacy settings respected (email, company, location visibility)

**Performance:**
- SQL LIMIT/OFFSET for efficient queries
