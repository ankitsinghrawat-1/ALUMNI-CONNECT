# Complete Database Fix Guide 🔧

## Problem Summary

You're experiencing two errors when creating threads:
1. ❌ `Unknown column 'thread_type' in 'field list'`
2. ❌ `Unknown column 'total_threads' in 'field list'`

## Root Cause

1. **thread_type error**: The `threads` table is missing 10 required columns
2. **total_threads error**: The `user_social_stats` table is missing the `total_threads` column (has `threads_count` but trigger expects `total_threads`)

## Solution: Run ONE Migration Script

### Step 1: Run the Complete Fix

```bash
mysql -u root -p alumni_db < COMPLETE_DATABASE_FIX.sql
```

**Enter your MySQL password when prompted.**

### Step 2: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Start fresh
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Thread Creation

1. Open your browser to the threads page
2. Try creating a new thread
3. ✅ Should work without any errors!

## What This Script Does

### Part 1: Fixes Threads Table
Adds 10 missing columns:
- ✅ `title` - Thread title
- ✅ `thread_type` - discussion/question/announcement/poll
- ✅ `category` - Topic category
- ✅ `is_anonymous` - Anonymous posting
- ✅ `target_audience` - all/alumni/students/faculty
- ✅ `batch_year` - Graduation year targeting
- ✅ `tags` - Comma-separated tags
- ✅ `content_warning` - none/sensitive/nsfw
- ✅ `scheduled_at` - Schedule publishing
- ✅ `is_published` - Draft vs published
- ✅ `read_time` - Estimated reading time

### Part 2: Fixes user_social_stats Table
- ✅ Adds `total_threads` column
- ✅ Syncs data with existing `threads_count`

### Part 3: Verification
- ✅ Checks all columns exist
- ✅ Confirms fix worked

## Verification Commands

After running the migration, verify it worked:

```sql
-- Check threads table
USE alumni_db;
DESCRIBE threads;

-- Should show: thread_type, category, title, is_anonymous, etc.
```

```sql
-- Check user_social_stats table  
DESCRIBE user_social_stats;

-- Should show: total_threads column
```

---

## Alternative: MySQL Workbench

If you prefer a GUI:

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your database
3. Open `COMPLETE_DATABASE_FIX.sql`
4. Click ⚡ Execute
5. Check output for success message

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Table 'alumni_db' doesn't exist"

Your database might be named differently. Check your database name:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Then update the script's first line:
```sql
USE your_actual_database_name;
```

### Error: "Column already exists"

This is OK! The script uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` which safely skips existing columns.

### Still Getting Errors?

1. Check your `server/database.js` or `.env` file for the correct database name
2. Make sure MySQL is running: `mysql --version`
3. Verify connection: `mysql -u root -p` then `SHOW DATABASES;`

This script fixes **BOTH** issues in one go:
- ✅ Fixes thread_type error
- ✅ Fixes total_threads error  
- ✅ Compatible with all MySQL versions
