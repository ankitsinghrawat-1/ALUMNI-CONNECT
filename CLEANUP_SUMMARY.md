## Duplicate Code Documented

### Profile Field Configuration
Found duplicate `roleFieldsConfig` object definitions in:
- `client/js/profile.js` (line 109)
- `server/api/users.js` (line 342)

**Action Taken:** Added documentation comments in both files noting the duplication and requiring synchronization when changes are made. This is necessary because the configuration is used independently on both client and server sides.

## Impact

- **Lines of code removed:** ~6,897 lines
- **Files cleaned up:** 22 files
- **Repository size reduced:** Significantly smaller and cleaner
- **Maintained functionality:** All active features remain intact
- **No breaking changes:** Application continues to work as expected

## Remaining Documentation

The following essential documentation files were kept:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `database_structure.txt` - Database schema reference
- SQL migration files - Database setup and updates

## Notes

- All deleted files were either duplicates, backups, test files, or redundant documentation
- No active features or functionality were removed
- The cleanup makes the repository easier to maintain and navigate
- Files like `become-mentor-enhanced.js` and `mentors-enhanced.js` were kept as they are actively used by the application
