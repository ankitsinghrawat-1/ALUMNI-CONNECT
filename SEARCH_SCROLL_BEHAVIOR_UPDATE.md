# Search Bar Scroll Behavior Update

## Change Summary

Updated the search bar scroll behavior to only show the search bar when the user scrolls to the very top of the page, not when scrolling up.

## Issue

Previously, the search bar would reappear whenever the user started scrolling up, even if they were still in the middle of the page. This was not the intended behavior since we now have a floating search button that provides access to search functionality at any scroll position.

## Solution

Modified the scroll event handler to use a simpler logic:

### Old Behavior
- **Scroll Down (>10% viewport):** Hide search bar, show floating button
- **Scroll Up (any position):** Show search bar, hide floating button ❌
- **At Top:** Show search bar, hide floating button

### New Behavior
- **At Top (scrollTop = 0):** Show search bar, hide floating button ✅
- **Scrolled Down (>10% viewport):** Hide search bar, show floating button ✅
- **Scrolling Up (but not at top):** Keep floating button visible, search bar hidden ✅

## Technical Implementation

### Before
```javascript
if (currentScrollTop > lastScrollTop && scrollPercentage > scrollThreshold) {
    // Scrolling down - hide search bar, show floating button
    // ...
} else if (currentScrollTop < lastScrollTop || currentScrollTop <= 0) {
    // Scrolling up or at top - show search bar, hide floating button
    // ...
}
```

### After
```javascript
if (currentScrollTop <= 0) {
    // At the very top - show search bar, hide floating button
    // ...
} else if (scrollPercentage > scrollThreshold) {
    // Scrolled down past threshold - hide search bar, show floating button
    // ...
}
```

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience
✅ Search bar no longer pops up unexpectedly when scrolling up
✅ Floating search button remains available throughout browsing
✅ Cleaner, less distracting interface
✅ Search bar only appears at the natural starting position (top of page)

### Consistent Behavior
✅ Floating button is the primary search access method when scrolled
✅ Search bar is only visible at the top where users expect it
✅ No conflicting UI elements during scroll

### Performance
✅ Simpler conditional logic
✅ Fewer DOM manipulations during scroll
✅ More predictable behavior
