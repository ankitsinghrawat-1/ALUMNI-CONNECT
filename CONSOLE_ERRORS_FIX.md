# JavaScript Console Errors Fix

## Errors Reported

The user reported the following console errors on the browse-mentors page:

1. `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'sanitizeHTML' has already been declared (at mentor-features-enhanced.js:1:1)`
2. `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'sanitizeHTML' has already been declared (at browse-mentors.js:1:1)`
3. `Could not fetch latest profile data for navbar: ReferenceError: io is not defined`

## Root Causes

### Issue 1 & 2: Duplicate `sanitizeHTML` Declarations

**Problem**: Multiple JavaScript files were trying to declare `sanitizeHTML` as a `const`:
- `utils.js` declares it (line 116)
- `mentor-features-enhanced.js` tried to redeclare it
- `browse-mentors.js` tried to redeclare it

When you use `const` to declare a variable, it cannot be redeclared. Since all these scripts are loaded on the same page (browse-mentors.html), the browser threw a SyntaxError.

**Script Loading Order** (browse-mentors.html):
```html
<script src="js/utils.js"></script>          <!-- Declares sanitizeHTML -->
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/api.js"></script>
<script src="js/mentor-features-enhanced.js"></script>  <!-- Tried to redeclare -->
<script src="js/browse-mentors.js"></script>            <!-- Tried to redeclare -->
```

### Issue 3: Missing socket.io Library

**Problem**: `auth.js` tries to use `io()` (Socket.IO client) to establish a WebSocket connection, but the Socket.IO library wasn't loaded on the browse-mentors.html page.

The code in auth.js (line 131) was:
```javascript
const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");
```

But `io` is undefined if the Socket.IO library isn't loaded.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1 & 2: Remove Duplicate Declarations

**File**: `client/js/browse-mentors.js`
- **Before**: Declared `const sanitizeHTML = window.sanitizeHTML || function(str) {...}`
- **After**: Removed the declaration, just using the global `sanitizeHTML` from utils.js

**File**: `client/js/mentor-features-enhanced.js`
- **Before**: Checked if undefined, then declared `const sanitizeHTML`
- **After**: Removed the declaration, just using the global `sanitizeHTML` from utils.js

Now both files rely on the single `sanitizeHTML` declaration from `utils.js`, which is loaded first.

### Fix 3: Conditional Socket.IO Usage

**File**: `client/js/auth.js`
- **Before**: Directly used `io()` without checking if it exists
- **After**: Wrapped socket.io code in a check:

```javascript
// Initialize socket.io only if the library is loaded
if (typeof io !== 'undefined') {
    const userId = loggedInUser.user_id;
    const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");
    // ... rest of socket code
}
```

This prevents the error on pages that don't load the Socket.IO library while still working on pages that do.

## Technical Details

### Why `const` Cannot Be Redeclared

In JavaScript, `const` creates a variable in the block scope that cannot be reassigned or redeclared. When multiple scripts try to declare the same `const` variable in the global scope, it causes a SyntaxError.

**Example of the error**:
```javascript
const sanitizeHTML = function() {...};  // In utils.js
const sanitizeHTML = function() {...};  // In browse-mentors.js - ERROR!
```

### Proper Pattern for Shared Utilities

The correct pattern is:
1. Define utility functions in a single place (utils.js)
2. Load that script first
3. Other scripts just use the global function (no redeclaration)

### Why Check for `io` Existence

Not all pages need Socket.IO (real-time features). Pages that don't need it shouldn't load the library. By checking `typeof io !== 'undefined'`, we make the code work on both:
- Pages with Socket.IO (messaging, notifications)
- Pages without Socket.IO (browse mentors, blogs, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. `client/js/browse-mentors.js` - Removed sanitizeHTML redeclaration
2. `client/js/mentor-features-enhanced.js` - Removed sanitizeHTML redeclaration
3. `client/js/auth.js` - Added conditional check for Socket.IO

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

### No More Console Errors ✅
- No "sanitizeHTML has already been declared" errors
- No "io is not defined" errors
- Clean console output

### Functionality Preserved ✅
- `sanitizeHTML` still works (from utils.js)
- Auth navbar still works
- Socket.IO features work on pages that load the library
- Browse mentors page works without Socket.IO

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Open browse-mentors.html in browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check Console tab
4. Should see:
   - ✅ No SyntaxError about sanitizeHTML
   - ✅ No ReferenceError about io
   - ✅ Mentors loading correctly
   - ✅ Navigation bar displaying correctly

## Impact

✅ **Security**: No impact - same sanitization function used
✅ **Performance**: Slightly better - no duplicate function definitions
✅ **Compatibility**: Works on all pages now
✅ **User Experience**: Clean console, no errors blocking functionality

## Related Issues

These errors were preventing the page from loading correctly because:
1. JavaScript execution stops when SyntaxErrors occur
2. Subsequent code doesn't run
3. Page functionality breaks

With these fixes, the JavaScript executes cleanly and the mentor loading fixes can work properly.
