# Directory Feature Backend Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds full backend functionality for all buttons in the alumni directory feature cards.

### 1. Database Schema

Created two new tables to support connection requests:

#### connection_requests table
- Stores connection requests between users
- Tracks status: pending, accepted, rejected
- Prevents duplicate requests with unique constraint
- Includes timestamps for tracking

#### connections table
- Stores accepted connections between users
- Uses normalized approach (user1_id < user2_id) to prevent duplicates
- Indexed for fast lookups

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

Implemented 4 new endpoints in `/server/api/users.js`:

#### POST /users/connect-request
- Sends a connection request from authenticated user to another user
- Features:
  - Validates user exists
  - Prevents self-connections
  - Checks for existing connections
  - Auto-accepts if reverse request exists
  - Creates notifications
  - Handles rejected request resubmission

#### GET /users/connection-status/:email
- Returns connection status between authenticated user and target user
- Possible statuses:
  - `connected`: Users are connected
  - `pending`: Current user sent a request
  - `received`: Current user received a request
  - `not_connected`: No connection exists

#### POST /users/accept-connection/:requestId
- Accepts a pending connection request
- Creates connection entry
- Updates request status
- Creates notification for requester

#### POST /users/reject-connection/:requestId
- Rejects a pending connection request
- Updates request status

### 3. Frontend Updates

Updated `/client/js/directory.js`:

#### Connection Status Display
- Changed from random status to real API calls
- Fetches actual connection status for each user
- Handles authentication state properly

#### Button States
The directory cards now display appropriate buttons based on connection status:

1. **Connect Button** (not_connected)
   - Visible when no connection exists
   - Sends connection request on click
   - Updates to "Request Sent" on success
   - Shows error toast on failure

2. **Request Sent Button** (pending)
   - Displayed when user has sent a request
   - Disabled state (non-clickable)
   - Visual indicator that request is pending

3. **View Request Button** (received)
   - Shown when user has received a request
   - Links to profile to accept/reject request

4. **View Profile Button** (connected)
   - Displayed for connected users
   - Links directly to user's profile page

5. **Message Button** (always visible)
   - Works for all users regardless of connection status
   - Redirects to messages page with user parameters
   - Pre-populates recipient information

### 4. Error Handling

- Validates user authentication
- Checks for existing connections/requests
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Shows appropriate error messages to users
- Prevents invalid operations (self-connection, duplicate requests)

### 5. Notifications

Automatic notification creation for:
- New connection requests
- Accepted connections
- Includes actor information and profile links

## How to Use

### Setup

1. **Run the SQL script to create tables:**
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p alumni_db < database_connection_requests.sql
```

2. **Configure environment:**
Ensure `.env` file has database credentials (already in `.gitignore`)

3. **Start the server:**
```bash
npm start
```

### Testing the Feature

1. **View Directory:**
   - Navigate to `/directory.html`
   - Browse alumni profiles

2. **Send Connection Request:**
   - Click "Connect" button on any profile
   - Button changes to "Request Sent"
   - Recipient receives notification

3. **Message User:**
   - Click "Message" button on any profile
   - Redirects to messages with pre-selected user

4. **View Profile:**
   - Click "View Profile" for connected users
   - Or click profile card to view details

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `database_connection_requests.sql` - Database schema
- `CONNECTION_REQUESTS_README.md` - Detailed API documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `server/api/users.js` - Added 4 new endpoints (205 lines added)
- `client/js/directory.js` - Updated connection status logic (57 lines modified)

## Security Features

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Users cannot connect to themselves
- Duplicate requests prevented at database level
- Only request recipients can accept/reject
- Connection status checks ensure proper authorization

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in → JWT token stored in localStorage as 'alumniConnectToken'
2. Token sent with all API requests via Authorization header
3. Backend verifies token and extracts user ID
4. Operations validated against authenticated user

### Connection Logic:
1. User A sends request to User B
2. If User B has pending request to User A → Auto-connect
3. Otherwise → Create pending request
4. User B can accept/reject from profile or notifications
5. On accept → Connection created, both notified

### Data Normalization:
- Connections stored with smaller user_id as user1_id
- Prevents duplicate rows for bidirectional relationships
- Efficient querying with proper indexes

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Batch connection status fetching for better performance
- Connection suggestions based on shared interests
- Connection request expiration
- Block/report functionality
- Connection analytics and insights
