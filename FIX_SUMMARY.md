# Quick Fix Summary - Mentor Profile Link Issue

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Fixed**: Mentor profile link not showing in navbar for mentor users
✅ **Fixed**: Constant API call failures to `/api/mentors/status`
✅ **Fixed**: Mentor status always returning false

## The Problem

The `/api/mentors/status` endpoint was using `optionalAuth` middleware but trying to access `req.user.userId` without checking if `req.user` was null, causing errors.

## The Solution

Changed the endpoint to use `verifyToken` middleware instead of `optionalAuth`:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
router.get('/status', optionalAuth, asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {

// AFTER (Fixed)  
router.get('/status', verifyToken, asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
```

## What This Means

1. The endpoint now requires authentication (user must be logged in)
2. No more null pointer errors when accessing user data
3. Proper error responses for unauthenticated requests
4. Mentor profile link will now show correctly in navbar for mentors

## How to Verify the Fix

### Quick Test:
1. Start your MySQL database
2. Run: `npm start`
3. Log in as a user who is registered as a mentor
4. Click on your profile picture in navbar
5. Click "My Profiles"
6. You should now see **three options**:
   - Main Profile
   - Social Profile  
   - **Mentor Profile** ← This should now appear!

### Check Database:
```sql
-- Verify a user is a mentor
SELECT user_id, email, is_mentor FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@test.com';
-- is_mentor should be 1 or TRUE

-- Verify mentor record exists
SELECT mentor_id, user_id FROM mentors WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
-- Should return a row with mentor_id
```

### Check API Response:
```bash
# Get your auth token from localStorage after logging in
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/mentors/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# For mentors, should return:
# {"isMentor":true,"mentorId":123}

# For non-mentors, should return:
# {"isMentor":false,"mentorId":null}
```

## Files Changed

- ✏️ **server/api/mentors.js** - Line 382: Changed `optionalAuth` to `verifyToken`

## No Breaking Changes

This fix does not affect:
- ✅ Other API endpoints
- ✅ Database structure
- ✅ Frontend code (auth.js works without changes)
- ✅ Mentor registration functionality
- ✅ Non-mentor users (they still see 2 profile links)
