# Mentor Profile Link Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
The mentor profile link was not appearing in the nested "My Profiles" dropdown menu for users who are registered as mentors. The API was not being called properly.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Authentication Middleware Issue
**Location**: `server/api/mentors.js` line 382

**Problem**: The `/api/mentors/status` endpoint was using `optionalAuth` middleware, which allows requests without authentication and sets `req.user = null` for unauthenticated requests. However, the code immediately tried to access `req.user.userId` without checking if `req.user` exists, causing a `TypeError` when processing the request.

**Solution**: Changed the middleware from `optionalAuth` to `verifyToken` since this endpoint is specifically designed to check the logged-in user's mentor status and requires authentication.

```javascript
// Before:
router.get('/status', optionalAuth, asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
    const user_id = req.user.userId; // Error: req.user could be null

// After:
router.get('/status', verifyToken, asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
    const user_id = req.user.userId; // Safe: verifyToken ensures req.user exists
```

### 2. Script Loading Order Issue
**Location**: 58 HTML files in the `client/` directory

**Problem**: Almost all HTML pages were loading `auth.js` before `api.js`, but `auth.js` depends on the `window.api` object being available. This caused the mentor status API call to fail with "window.api is not defined" error.

**Files Affected**:
- All client-side HTML files except `index.html` and `about.html` (which had the correct order)
- Total: 58 files fixed

**Solution**: Modified all HTML files to load `api.js` before `auth.js`:

```html
<!-- Before (WRONG ORDER): -->
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/api.js"></script>

<!-- After (CORRECT ORDER): -->
<script src="js/api.js"></script>
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>
```

## Technical Flow After Fix

1. **Page loads** → `api.js` loads first and creates `window.api` object with methods for HTTP requests
2. **Then** → `auth.js` loads and runs its initialization code
3. **Auth initialization**:
   - Checks if user is logged in (token exists)
   - Retrieves user info from localStorage
   - Calls `window.api.get('/mentors/status')` with authentication header
4. **Server processing**:
   - `verifyToken` middleware validates JWT token
   - Extracts `userId` from verified token
   - Queries database for user's mentor status
   - Returns `{ isMentor: boolean, mentorId: number|null }`
5. **Client processing**:
   - If `isMentor === true` and `mentorId` exists:
     - Creates mentor profile link HTML
     - Includes it in the nested "My Profiles" dropdown
   - Otherwise: mentor profile link remains empty string

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Regular Users (Non-Mentors)
When clicking the profile picture in the navbar:
1. Profile dropdown opens
2. Click "My Profiles" 
3. See nested dropdown with 2 options:
   - Main Profile
   - Social Profile

### For Mentors
When clicking the profile picture in the navbar:
1. Profile dropdown opens
2. Click "My Profiles"
3. See nested dropdown with 3 options:
   - Main Profile
   - Social Profile  
   - **Mentor Profile** ← This now appears correctly!

## Testing Recommendations

To test the fix:

1. **Test with non-mentor user**:
   - Login as a user who is not a mentor
   - Click profile picture
   - Click "My Profiles"
   - Verify only 2 options appear (Main Profile, Social Profile)

2. **Test with mentor user**:
   - Login as a user who is a mentor
   - Click profile picture
   - Click "My Profiles"
   - Verify 3 options appear (Main Profile, Social Profile, Mentor Profile)
   - Click "Mentor Profile"
   - Verify it navigates to `mentor-profile.html?id={mentorId}`

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Should see extensive debug logs from auth.js
   - Look for "✓ SUCCESS: Mentor profile link created!" message
   - Should NOT see "✗ window.api is not defined!" error

## API Endpoint Details

### GET `/api/mentors/status`
**Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)

**Response for mentors**:
```json
{
  "isMentor": true,
  "mentorId": 123
}
```

**Response for non-mentors**:
```json
{
  "isMentor": false,
  "mentorId": null
}
```

**Error response**:
```json
{
  "isMentor": false,
  "mentorId": null,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The extensive console logging in both `auth.js` and `mentors.js` was left in place as it helps diagnose issues
- The fix maintains backward compatibility - no breaking changes to existing functionality
- The nested dropdown structure and styling were already in place and working correctly
- The only issues were the API call failing due to script loading order and authentication problems
