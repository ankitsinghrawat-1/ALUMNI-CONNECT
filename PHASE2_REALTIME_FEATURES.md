);

// Get reactions
const reactions = await window.api.get(
    `/social-feed-phase2/threads/${threadId}/reactions`
);

// Add co-author
await window.api.post(
    `/social-feed-phase2/threads/${threadId}/co-authors`,
    { user_id: coauthorId }
);

// Save quality score
await window.api.post(
    `/social-feed-phase2/threads/${threadId}/quality`,

# Verify tables created
mysql -u root -p alumni_connect -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE '%thread_%';"
```

# The server needs to be restarted to load new API routes
npm start
```

### 3. Client Updates
No action needed! All HTML files are already updated with:
- Socket.IO client library
- WebSocket integration script
- Phase 2 API calls

### 4. Testing
```bash
# Open browser console on threads page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
```javascript

// Should see: "Client connected: [socket-id]"
```

### Reactions Not Saving
```sql
-- Check if table exists
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'thread_reactions';

-- Check for any reactions
SELECT * FROM thread_reactions LIMIT 5;
```

### Viewer Count Not Updating
```javascript
// Verify user is set
console.log(window.socialFeedWS.currentUserId);
console.log(window.socialFeedWS.currentUserName);

// Check if viewing thread
console.log(window.socialFeedWS.viewingThreads);
```

- **Q: Database errors on API calls**
  - A: Run `database_phase2_schema.sql` to create missing tables

### Getting Help
- Check browser console for errors
- Check server logs for WebSocket messages
