---

## Accessibility

- All buttons have proper `title` attributes
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast
- Icon + text combinations for clarity
- Semantic HTML structure

- Skills comparison uses efficient array filtering
- Menu animations use CSS transitions (GPU-accelerated)
- Event delegation for outside clicks
- No API calls for these features (client-side only)
