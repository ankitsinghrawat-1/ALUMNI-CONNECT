## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Emoji picker not appearing
**Solution:** Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure `EmojiPicker` class is defined.

### Issue: Autocomplete not working
**Solution:** Check if API endpoints exist for user/hashtag search. Look for 404 errors in Network tab.

### Issue: Reactions not saving
**Solution:** Backend API endpoint `/api/reactions` may not exist. Check Network tab for errors.

### Issue: Dark mode not persisting
**Solution:** Check if `localStorage.setItem('theme', ...)` is being called. Check browser localStorage.

### Issue: Images not lazy loading
**Solution:** Ensure `IntersectionObserver` is supported in browser. Check for polyfill if needed.

## API Endpoint Verification

Check if these endpoints exist on your backend:

### Required for Full Functionality:
- `GET /api/threads` - List threads
- `POST /api/threads` - Create thread
- `GET /api/threads/:id` - Get thread detail
- `POST /api/comments` - Add comment
- `POST /api/reactions` - Add reaction (may be missing)
- `DELETE /api/reactions/:id` - Remove reaction (may be missing)
- `POST /api/bookmarks` - Add bookmark (may be missing)
- `DELETE /api/bookmarks/:id` - Remove bookmark (may be missing)
- `GET /api/users/search?q=` - Search users for @mentions (may be missing)
- `GET /api/hashtags/search?q=` - Search hashtags (may be missing)

### How to Check:
1. Open Browser DevTools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Perform actions
4. Look for API calls
5. Check response status (200 = OK, 404 = Not Found, 500 = Server Error)
